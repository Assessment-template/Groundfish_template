### Terms of Reference Template in R Markdown

Converted from Word by Melissa Monk, NOAA SWFSC

### How to use this template

1. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed
    * rmarkdown
    * r4ss
    * knitr
    * xtable

Perhaps some text could be added here on the commands required to convert an R Markdown (.Rmd) file to PDF or whatever other formats we might require.

### When to get China Rockfish-specific

Any thoughts on when to split China-specific work from the general template?
