### Terms of Reference Template in R Markdown

Converted from Word by Melissa Monk, NOAA SWFSC

### How to use this template

1. Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed
    * rmarkdown
    * r4ss
    * knitr
    * xtable
2. Make sure you have TeX installed
    * Add any required LaTeX packages to the header.tex file

3. Template is using the citation style of CJAFS, but this can be changed by altering the .csl file in the YAML

4. The bibliography is currently generated from the chinarockfish2015.bib file.  Add references to the China Rockfish Assessment 2015 group on Mendeley.  The .bib file will be generated from this list of references.  Mendeley is a reference manager found here: http://www.mendeley.com/.  


Perhaps some text could be added here on the commands required to convert an R Markdown (.Rmd) file to PDF or whatever other formats we might require.

### When to get China Rockfish-specific

Any thoughts on when to split China-specific work from the general template?  
Melissa's thought: Do you think any any other STAT teams want to use the template this cycle?  If so, then we can distribute what we have whenever.  If not, we can strip down our final report to create a template.
